## Introduction
### Dataset Description
In this project, we will be investigating the tmdb-movies dataset. This dataset contains information about various movies, including details like revenue, budget, release year, genres, and audience scores. The dataset allows us to analyze the different generations of movies based on ratings, number of successful movies, average profits, and explore the best categories and most popular movies.

### Question(s) for Analysis
The analysis will focus on answering the following research questions:
1. What generation of movies was believed to be better by the audience, based on ratings, number of successful movies, and average profits?
2. What are the best categories of movies and the most popular ones?

## Data Wrangling
In the data wrangling phase, we will perform the following operations on the dataset:
1. Checking for duplicates and missing data.
2. Identifying and removing unnecessary columns.
3. Handling missing values in the budget and revenue columns.
4. Transforming the release_date column into a datetime datatype.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In the exploratory data analysis phase, we will analyze the dataset to gain insights and answer the research questions. This will involve visualizing the data, calculating statistics, and exploring relationships between variables.
